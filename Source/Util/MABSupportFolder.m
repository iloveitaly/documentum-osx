/*
 There should only be once instance of this support controller, I usually created a instace in my MainMenu.nib file then
 use -[MABSupportFolder sharedController] to access the instance in my code.
 
 You can easily extend this class and add methods to manipulate/manage the support folder in any way you please.
 One glitch you may come across when extending subclassing is the +sharedController method. 
 GCC will give you warnings that MABSupportController will not respond to a method you added onto your subclass.
 You can silence GCC by adding this method to your subclass:
 +(AppSupportController *) sharedController { return (AppSupportController *) [super sharedController]; }
 where AppSupportController is you new subclass.
